# **Code Commerce: Full-Stack E-commerce Store**

## **Overview**

Code Commerce is a comprehensive full-stack e-commerce store project where developers can sell pre-built code projects and snippets. The project started as a React application and evolved into a full-stack system using React with TypeScript, integrating the open-source Node API CommerceJS for backend functionality.

## **Key Focus Areas**

- Forms and form validation with React
- Building stateful components
- Passing data between components
- Working with APIs
- Understanding and implementing TypeScript
- Converting class components and implementing functional components
- State management using React Context API
- Using and understanding form and input management with React-Hook-Form
- Implementing UI/UX with "Mobile-First" design principles

## **Features & Technical Implementation**

- **User Authentication:** Enabled users to sign up and log in, with advanced form validation and error handling.
- **Product Display & Search:** Implemented a dynamic product display system with categorization and search functionality.
- **Customer Cart:** Constructed an interactive shopping cart system, with item quantity adjustment and removal features.

## **Backend & API**

- Leveraged the open-source Node API, CommerceJS, to create backend functionality.
- Developed a product database with various categories and items, each featuring an image, title, description, quantity, and price.
- Integrated CommerceJS's API with the front end, fetching, and parsing product data for display in the UI.

## **Conclusion**

Code Commerce showcases my abilities in building robust e-commerce applications, integrating APIs, implementing advanced functionalities, and providing a user-friendly interface. The evolution of the project from a simple React application to a full-stack solution using React and TypeScript demonstrates my growth and adaptability as a developer.
