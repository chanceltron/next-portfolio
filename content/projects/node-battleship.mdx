# **Battleship Terminal Game**

## **Overview**

This project is an implementation of the classic board game, Battleship, designed to be played in a terminal. The game was developed purely using JavaScript and the readline-sync npm package for synchronous readline. The main focus of the project was to enhance coding skills, understanding of fundamental data structures, and algorithms.

## **Features**

### **Part 1: Basic Game Structure**

- On application load, the game prompts, "Press any key to start the game."
- Two ships are randomly placed on the board once the user initiates the game.
- The user can guess a location to attack. The game responds with messages whether the attack was a hit, miss, or a repeated location.
- The game continues until all ships are destroyed, and offers an option to play again.

### **Part 2: Advanced Grid and Ship Placement**

- The grid structure was expanded to a 10x10 grid using letters A-J and numbers 1-10.
- Added a dynamic grid builder function to create a grid of any given size.
- The ship placement feature was improved, now allowing for one 2-unit ship, two 3-unit ships, one 4-unit ship, and one 5-unit ship to be randomly placed on the board without overlap.

### **Part 3: GUI Grid**

- Incorporated a GUI-based grid in the terminal, marking hits with "X" and misses with "O", which refreshes after every turn.

### **Part 4: Multiplayer Feature**

- Modified the game for a player vs. computer mode. Ships for both player and computer are positioned automatically at the start.
- Each turn consists of the player's attack followed by the computer's attack, with feedback on the outcomes of both attacks.

## **Technical Details**

This game was developed purely in JavaScript, and the following main technologies and techniques were used:

- **JavaScript**: The game logic, data structures, and algorithms were implemented using JavaScript.

- **readline-sync npm package**: This package was used to create a synchronous interface for readline, allowing the user to input their attack locations and game decisions.

- **Modular functions**: The code was written in a way that each function performs a single objective, making the code more readable, modular, and reusable.

## **Conclusion**

This terminal-based Battleship game serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in JavaScript, understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, and ability to create a user-friendly terminal game. With features like dynamic grid creation and a player vs. computer mode, this project reflects my capability to develop interactive and fun terminal-based games.
